# Patient-Readmission-Analysis
---
The aim of this project is to analyze patterns in patient readmission of a hospital, in order to understand the characteristics of patients who risk being readmitted to the hospital. Based on this pattern, the a classification model could be made, which can be used to predict if a patient would be readmitted or not. At the same time, in this project I would also attempt to do clustering in order to create a patient segmentation.
